## üñºÔ∏è Project Context

This is one of the **required projects** to earn the **Responsive Web Design certification** on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).  
It helped me improve my skills in:

- Structuring semantic HTML content
- Creating fixed and accessible navigation
- Using layout techniques with CSS
- Making responsive designs with media queries
- Organizing technical content in a clear and readable way
